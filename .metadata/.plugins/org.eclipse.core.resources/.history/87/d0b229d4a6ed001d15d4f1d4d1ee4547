How to use the project
Run the Jason project, this project define two group of customer: c2 and tong, they can eat in the restaurant in the same time (considering conflict) 
and in the different time(run separately).
1. Run different time
in the mas2j file, give the initial belief of each customer, the time(Time) is about the time for customer to enter the restaurant.
set a longer time for tong to let it enter slowly, assume they will not eat at the same time as c2 customer. For example, let 
tong customer[beliefs="number(2), time(20000)", goals="enter"], so it will wait for 20 seconds to enter the restaurant.

Show the functions of each customer, choose c2 first, after c2 sit down, click call waiter button to call the waiter and start order, after input the 
food name in the input textfield, click order to process an order. The waiter will walk to kitchen to tell chef.
After the chef finished for the order, click cookdone button to tell the waiter pick up and deliever the c2's order.
Then, after c2 finished, c2 will walk to the frontdesk to pay, while frontdesk tell waiter to clean this area.
tong customer have the same process as c2.
The process should be

2. With conflict, c2 and tong enter the restaurant at the same time, make a slight time different, for example, set
tong customer[beliefs="number(2), time(1000)", goals="enter"].
